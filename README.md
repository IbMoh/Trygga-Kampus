## Overview
Trygga Kampus is designed to help university students, starting with HKR, raise awareness about addiction in all its forms. 
The app provides a safe and supportive platform for students struggling with addiction to access information, reflect on their experiences, and take the first step toward seeking help. 
Inspired by Per Olof MÃ¥rtensson's ["Trygga Klassen"](https://tryggaklassen.se/) we adapted the concept to meet the needs of university students.

## Purpose
The main goal of this application is to:
- Raise awareness about addiction (substance abuse, behavioural addictions) among university students.
- Provide students with accessible resources, support, and tools to reflect on their challenges.
- Facilitate the first step toward seeking help by offering a contact form to connect with support services.

## Features
- **Information Base/Bank**: 
  - A repository of detailed articles covering different forms of addiction, including drugs, alcohol, and behavioural issues.
- **Drug Articles**: 
  - Focused resources on substance addiction, providing educational content on risks, signs, and recovery paths.
- **Surveys**: 
  - Interactive surveys to encourage students to reflect on their own experiences.
- **Reflections**: 
  - A self-reflection feature that guides users to evaluate how addiction or bullying may be affecting their lives.
- **Get in Touch**: 
  - A contact form allowing students to easily reach out for help or connect with university counsellors or Per Olof directly through his company ["Lotusmodellen"](https://lotusmodellen.se/wp/).
- **Our Stories**:
  - Stories shared by student with their own experience with addiction. The goal of this feature is so that students can maybe relate with some struggles or recognize some signs of addictions.
- **Advice Page**:  
  - Some advice cards to help with certain scenarios such as "Prevention", "Supporting a friend" or "How to talk to your family about your addictions". This is to encourage students to take the first steps in supporting, managing or confronting their addiction.
