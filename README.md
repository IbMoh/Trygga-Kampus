## Overview
Trygga Kampus is designed to help university students, starting with HKR, raise awareness about addiction in all its forms. 
The app provides a safe and supportive platform for students struggling with addiction to access information, reflect on their experiences, and take the first step toward seeking help. 
Inspired by Per Olof MÃ¥rtensson's ["Trygga Klassen"](https://tryggaklassen.se/) we adapted the concept to meet the needs of university students.

## Purpose
The main goal of this application is to:
- Raise awareness about addiction (substance abuse, behavioral addictions) among university students.
- Provide students with accessible resources, support, and tools to reflect on their challenges.
- Facilitate the first step toward seeking help by offering a contact form to connect with support services.

## Features
- **Information Base/Bank**: 
  - A repository of detailed articles covering different forms of addiction, including drugs, alcohol, and behavioral issues.
- **Drug Articles**: 
  - Focused resources on substance addiction, providing educational content on risks, signs, and recovery paths.
- **Surveys for ANDT and Bullying**: 
  - Interactive surveys on alcohol, narcotics, doping, tobacco (ANDT), and bullying to encourage students to reflect on their own experiences.
- **Reflections**: 
  - A self-reflection feature that guides users to evaluate how addiction or bullying may be affecting their lives.
- **Get in Touch**: 
  - A contact form allowing students to easily reach out for help or connect with professional services.

### Additional Features (Future Updates)
- **Our Stories**: 
  - A feature allowing students to share their personal stories about addiction and recovery, fostering a supportive community.
- **Map of Help Centers**: 
  - A location-based map showing nearby help centers such as women's shelters, Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), and Narcotics Anonymous (NA).

## Target Audience
This app primarily targets university students, starting with HKR, with plans to expand to other institutions as needed.
