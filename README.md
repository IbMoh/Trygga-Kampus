## Overview
Trygga Campus is designed to help university students, starting with Högskola Kristianstad (HKR), to raise awareness about addiction in all its forms. 
The app provides a safe and supportive platform for students struggling with addiction to access information, reflect on their experiences, and take the first step toward seeking help. 
Inspired by Per Olof Mårtensson's ["Trygga Klassen"](https://tryggaklassen.se/) we adapted the concept to meet the needs of university students.

## Purpose
The main goal of this application is to:
- Raise awareness about addiction (substance abuse, behavioural addictions) among university students.
- Provide students with accessible resources, support, and tools to reflect on their challenges.
- Facilitate the first step toward seeking help by offering a contact form to connect with support services.

## Features
- **Landing Page**:
  - An interactive landing page that displays basic information about the app and a quick option to go to the form to get in touch.
- **Articles**: 
  - Focused resources on substance addiction, providing educational content on risks, signs, and recovery paths (Articles can be added by an authorized login (ex: teacher/counselor))
- **Surveys**: 
  - Interactive surveys to encourage students to reflect on their own experiences.
- **Form**: 
  - A contact form allowing students to easily reach out for help or connect with Per Olof directly through his company ["Lotusmodellen"](https://lotusmodellen.se/wp/).
- **Stories**:
  - Stories shared by student with their own experience with addiction. The goal of this feature is so that students can maybe relate with some struggles or recognize some signs of addictions.
- **Advice Page**:  
  - Some advice cards to help with certain scenarios such as "Prevention", "Supporting a friend" or "How to talk to your family about your addictions". This is to encourage students to take the first steps in supporting, managing or confronting their addiction.

### Future Planned Features
- **Profile Page**:
   - Profile page to display student information, name, see their survey answers and have a profile picture
- **Student Login Via Universities**:
   - The idea is to use university login to access the app and student information will be used via their respective universities.
- **Language Translation**:
   - In the near future, we aim to have the application translated into Swedish and Arabic, for now.
- **Get in Touch (Enhanced)**
   - Once university agreements are completed, we want to add an option to choose between contacting the school counsellors or Per Olof at Lotusmodellen directly, depending on which option they prefer.
